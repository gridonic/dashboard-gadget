# Default grunt task
#
# Runs the dev build and spawns all concurrent tasks as parallel processes.
# This usually sets up watch tasks to watch for changes in source files
# and/or starts the local development server
default:
    - 'dev'

# Development build
dev:
    - 'clean'
    - 'lint'
    - 'browserify:build'
    - 'sass:dev'
    - 'postcss:dev'

# Production build
prod:
    - 'clean'
    - 'lint'
    - 'browserify:build'
    - 'uglify'
    - 'sass:prod'
    - 'postcss:prod'

lint:
    - 'sasslint'

# Watch task
#
# We have to name this "watchify" since watch is already a task so we cannot
# define an alias for it. Browserify needs to be started separately from watch
# in order to work.
watchify:
    - 'concurrent:all'
